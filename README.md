Console application for Array Parsing Homework -Christopher Cody Dunn

This Console application is built to recieve and store a quanitity of delimited numbers. The application is designed so the user can
decide how many numbers will be stored in the array. After the user has entered all of the expected input, it is displayed for
the user to review. 


-Struggles-

There were very few struggles for me while writing this application outside of the simple fact that this is my first C# application
and im getting use to everything, thankfully. The main and really the only one worth noting is that I could not figure out how to 
get the program to ignore invalid input which is letters, puncuation marks, and symbols in this case. I tried a few different ways to 
inplement this into the program but was no successful doing so. I have been able to do this in other programs(different languages) but
not yet for C#. I have put it in my notes to continue to learn it this week. I feel like I got really close but just no cigar. I tryed
to  make an if statement using the "ContainsString" method along with a few other ways I thought of with an if statement, didn't work.
I also tried using the try/catch statements and played around with a few ways of going about it that way none successful obviously. All
around though I feel like this was a good program to start out with and I look forward to diving more into the C# language.
